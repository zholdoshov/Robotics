Here is two projects:
1. AI car
  It is a AI car that has camera and distance detection sensor "Ultra sound sensor". The aim of the car is go to the finish by following colors and escaping barriers in the reoad
  Used materials and tools: Raspberry Pi, 2 Ultra Sound, Pi Camera, GPIO breakout board with ribbon cable, two motors, two wheel encoders, two capacitors, 4 resistor, power bank,
  4 batteries AA4, two wheels.
  How it works?
	By Color: The car with three wheels and with camera. It goes with detecting colors on the road. Used three colors to move car, colors: Orange, Green and Pink.
  If it detects orange stops, if there is pink it goes to the left, if green detects it goes to the right and if there is other colors or no colors it always goes forward.

2. Walking Robot
  A hexapod robot is a mechanical vehicle that walks on six legs. Since a robot can be statically stable on three or more legs, a hexapod robot has a great deal of
  flexibility in how it can move
